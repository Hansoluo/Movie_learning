## ex1-ex4 print and comment

- compile use `javac`, and will generate filename.class, then run program use `java`, use the class name, not filename. so if you modify the program, must recompile the program
- like C++, use `;` as a end
- `println()` print string on screen, and add a "\n", go to another line, but `print` will not
- sublime print `main`, and will automatic completion the fuction statement
- file name must same as the public class name, and one file must have only one public class name
- comment use // and  /* just like c++
